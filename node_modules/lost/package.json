You're also welcome to tweet [@LostGrid](https://twitter.com/lostgrid) if an issue seems too formal.\n\n*********\n\n## Getting Started\n* [Installation Guide](https://github.com/peterramsing/lost/wiki/Installation)\n* [Getting Started Video](https://youtu.be/6FN7QU1ZxqA)\n\nLostGrid makes use of [`calc()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc) to create stunning grids based on fractions you define without having to pass a lot of options.\n\nRead the docs on [LostGrid.org](http://lostgrid.org/docs.html)!\n\n## Browser Support\n- LostGrid relies on [`calc()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc) to create the grid. Thus, LostGrid is limited to browsers that support `calc()`. The great thing is that `calc()` is widely supported in all current browsers and the LostGrid usage of `calc()` is supported as far back as IE9+.\n- **If using LostGrid in flexbox mode** browser support is limited to IE 10+.\n- [Calc browser support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=calc)\n- [Flexbox browser support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)\n\n### Official Support\n- LostGrid is tested in the following browsers for compatibility\n  - IE10+ (IE9 has the same `calc()` support as IE10 except for background position which LostGrid doesn't affect)\n  - Evergreen Browsers (as they update automatically, tests are performed on the latest version of the following browsers)\n    - Chrome\n      - Chrome Canary + Chromium as well\n    - Opera\n    - Firefox\n      - FirefoxDeveloperEdition as well\n    - Edge\n  - Safari 9+\n- Automated browser testing with Selenium is coming soon. 👍\n\nNote: LostGrid no longer supports Node 0.10 and 0.12. I'll be following the [Node LTS plan for Node](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts-schedule). Let me know if you any questions.
